   TYPE II DIABETES RISK DETECTION USING GRADIENT BOOSTING ALGORITHM
   This research paper intends to develop a web application that can detect the risk of Mellitus. The researchers used machine learning techniques to develop a model that can detect the risk of Type II Diabetes Mellitus based on the userâ€™s health data.
The Sylhet Diabetes dataset was used as the training set of the study. The researchers tested several algorithms to know which works best to address the problem. It was found the Gradient Boosting algorithm is the most suitable for the system as it garnered the best performance metrics against the other algorithms.
The Type II Diabetes Risk Detection Web App used the Gradient Boosting model created by the researchers and it is supported by Flask on its backend. The Web app can detect whether the user has a high or low risk of having Type II diabetes. It can also provide tips and recommendations on the user on how to deal with Type II diabetes.
The system underwent several validation processes. It was validated using 25010 and the predictions of the model were tested with the medical results of users with Type II diabetes which the researchers personally gathered.
The Type II Diabetes Risk Detection Web App can help people identify their risk of having Type II diabetes and encourage them to seek the advice of medical professionals. It raises the awareness of people thereby reducing the tragic effects of late diagnosis of the disease.
